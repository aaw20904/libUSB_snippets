When there is a yellow triangle with attention (!) symbol - a driver for device is not installed.
So it is mandatory to have a driver for working together with the libUSB.
Therefore, the winusb driver must be installed.
There are 2 ways:
1) Use the Zadig
2) manuall installation - explicity with PID/VID information about the device inside .inf
